### Project Title
3 City Bikeshare Analysis

### Description
This project takes raw bikeshare trip data from 3 different U.S. cities and calculates various usage statistics based on user input

### Files used
bikeshare.py

The project raw data is stored in 3 csv files:
washington.csv, new_york_city.csv and chicago.csv.
These files are each about 35mb in size and so have not been included in this github repository.

### Credits
